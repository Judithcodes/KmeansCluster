# KmeansCluster

This is a realization of the K-means clustering algorithm written by MATLAB. Here is the file structure:

```
KmeansCluster
    |--src
        |--mykmeans.m
        |--mycluster_plus.m
        |--mydist.m
        |--mydist_corre.m
        |--mydist_cosine.m
        |--mydist_hamm.m
        |--mydrawkmeans.m
        |--myerrcal.m
        |--mynumstatistic.m
    |--kmeastest.m
    |--Readme.md
```
Among the files above:
- file 'kmeastest.m' is the test file to examine the performance of the code—— 9 matlab files in folder 'src';
- file 'mykmeans.m' is the main file to realize K-means clustering algorithm;
- the rest 8 *.m are called functions by mykmeans.m
