# KmeansCluster

This is a realization of the K-means clustering algorithm written by MATLAB. Here is the file structure:

```
KmeansCluster
    |-- src
        |-- mykmeans.m
        |-- mycluster_plus.m
        |-- mydist.m
        |-- mydist_corre.m
        |-- mydist_cosine.m
        |-- mydist_hamm.m
        |-- mydrawkmeans.m
        |-- myerrcal.m
        |-- mynumstatistic.m
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- Readme.md
    |-- kmeastest.m
    |-- 算法 _ k-means聚类.md
```
Among the files above:
- file 'mykmeans.m' is the main file to realize K-means clustering algorithm;
- the rest 8 XXX.m in dict 'src' are called functions by mykmeans.m;
- file 'LICENSE' is the license file produced by github;
- file 'kmeastest.m' is the test file to examine the performance of the code—— 9 matlab files in folder 'src';
- file '算法_k-means聚类.md' is a detailed introduction document for this project.
